Let me introduce you to the characters first.

Pratik (that's me) , a first year student at IITK.

Siddhant,another guy who somehow also made it here.

Siddhant: bhai hm kya kr rhe hai is baar Antaragni me ?

Me: abe dekhte hai. kuch na kuch to kr hi lenge.

And that's when I heard it. The same words I had heard countless times before which invariably meant one and only one thing : we're gonna end up doing nothing yet again.

SO, this time i have decided to do something. This time i am gonna do a blog post covering THE carnival of the north, Antaragni.
