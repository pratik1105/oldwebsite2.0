The time is 1 26 am on what is now a Thursday. Having spent the evening in the computer center watching house of cards, i am on my way back to my hostel. But wait, let me first get a glimpse of the auditorium grounds, the place that is going to witness absolute mayhem in the days to come. As i walk out of the academic area onto the streets, the pitch black background is invaded by one thing and one thing only, the blinding spotlight on the stage set in the grounds. Must admit, the organizers have done a fine job in a limited time.

As i hurry along, passing couples sharing moments beneath the moonlight, the Old Sac shows up. And my word, it was brimming with life. I had no choice but to join in. The deserted, under construction food stalls i left you with in my last post were now like a full on party. People enjoying food and drinks with their friends is always a pretty sight. And indeed the guys at Show Management have impressed.

Siddhant, Abhinav and others were already there working with their groups. I reached, making my way through the artists busy on the wall, the coordinators gearing up and the junta having fun, to the back of the Old Sac where students from various places were engaged in a 'showdown'. The Robot dance, popping and locking everything happening somewhere or the other. While a couple of us enjoyed it along with the stunning company we had ;) , i broke off to meet the guys at Fine arts club.

Finally , i enter  the room full of 'artists' in the truest sense. Posters , portraits and what not greeted me as i tried to find Sankalp and Rohit, my wing mates. Both of them, in a trance of their own creation, had eyes only for their work. So we met. The usual routine followed, a few jokes were cracked,few insults were thrown and you know the rest.  I asked for a few pictures which they happily provided and so knowing that they were not going to bed anytime soon and that i had to, i bid adieu and made my way back to the hostel.
