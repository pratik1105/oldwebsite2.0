She:Can you see now ?  
He: Yes,I see a dark face.  
She: Why the colour ?  
He: Duh. His race.

She: does race matter?

He: Yes ofcourse, it tells me to stay away.

She: Really ? But what if you needed him ?

He: oh Please, why would i ? He was worth less than what i spent just today.  
She: But what if he did offer something you needed ?

He: I only take from my equals,something he can't be no matter how hard he tries.

She: Doctor, My friend here would like to return a pair of eyes.
