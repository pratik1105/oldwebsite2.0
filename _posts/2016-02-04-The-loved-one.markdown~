Past, a neat little word that is used to define me,a complexity beyond comprehend.  
like a trail to the summit of a mountain,that no one has been able to ascend.

Imagine my past to be a painting that took years to unveil  
you are the reason it's not for sale

You came,you saw,you conquered, like a lesson too easy to learn,  
all my senses were pawns in a game of chess and now it was your turn.

But then you left,leaving a smear in the painting that cannot be restored,  
Now the king stands vulnerable and alone, his queen has left the board.

Memories, turned into a breeding ground for insomnia, is all that remains  
it's not blood anymore, it's pain that pumps through my veins.
