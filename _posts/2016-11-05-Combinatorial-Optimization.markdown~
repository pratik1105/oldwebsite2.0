This Project was done during the course **CS774:Optimization Techniques** under Professor Purushottam Kar at IIT Kanpur.

This was a reading project on Problems of Combinatorial Optimization such as the [Travelling salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) and the [Max Flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem). 

We provide a comprehensive survey of the problems by compiling applications and both exact and heuristic solutions to said problems with the optimization guarantees of each solution.

You can find the project report on [Github](https://github.com/pratik1105/CS-774).
