This Project was done during the course **CS671:Natural Language Processing** under Professor Harish Karnick at IIT Kanpur.

This project involved using NLP techniques such as **Topic Modelling**, implemented using [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) analysis, to find indicators for fraudulent behavior in the Enron Emails dataset.

You can find the report, Presentation and the python scripts for the project on [Github](https://github.com/pratik1105/CS-671).
