They don't make it rain anymore,  
like they used to a decade ago.  
Time seems to be running for it's life,  
back then, I swear, it used to move slow.  

The world says that we are 10 years older,  
but it feels like we have all just moved 10 years apart.  
Back then, we would race to the finish,  
Most of us now even hesitate to start.  

Remember when the heaviest weight on our shoulders,  
used to be the bags we lugged around ?  
Those wonderful memories have had to bear so much,  
they are hiding deep, and may never be found.  

Nostalgia hits us all, at moments we least expect.  
It aims for our hearts, and how to deal with it,  
I have not yet learnt.  
But here's something I do know,  
They don't make it rain anymore,  
like they used to a decade ago.
